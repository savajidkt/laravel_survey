  <h2 class="page_head">Introduction</h2>
  <p><b>Relational Intelligence (RI) is the ability to successfully connect with people and build strong, long-lasting relationships.</b> This is a critically important skill in business, where today's leaders need to create cultures of excellence that are relationship-oriented and foster great employee engagement. When put into practice, Relational Intelligence enables leaders to effectively communicate with employees from different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. It lays the groundwork for having a positive and meaningful impact on the development of employees in your organization. Relationally intelligent leaders are <b>intentional</b> and <b>authentic</b> in how they build relationships. They create the conditions in which employees can bring their true selves to work. When this happens, organizations build inclusive cultures where people feel valued, heard, and a sense of belonging and purpose in their work and the business.</p>
  <p>Based on more than 20 years of research on leadership, relationships, and influence, Dr. Adam C. <b>Bandelli developed the Bandelli Relational Intelligence Model.</b> This groundbreaking work originated from his doctoral studies at the University of South Florida where he completed his dissertation focused on identifying the key skills leaders need to build dynamic, life-changing relationships with their employees. Today, the <b>Bandelli Relational Intelligence Model</b> focuses on five essential skills: (1) Establishing Rapport, (2) Understanding Others, (3) Embracing Individual Differences, (4) Developing Trust, and (5) Cultivating Influence. Research conducted by organizational psychologists at Bandelli & Associates has found that these five skills are related and can predict key organizational performance outcomes including: growth mindset, employee engagement, organizational commitment, employee retention, and financial profitability.</p>
  <p>To assess the Relational Intelligence Model, Bandelli & Associates has developed the <b>Bandelli Relational Intelligence Assessment<sup>Â®</sup></b>. This assessment provides leaders with a deep understanding of their strengths and development opportunities related to each of the five skills of Relational Intelligence. The test was designed for leaders ranging from senior executives in the C-suite to leaders on the frontlines. Our data science and analytics team developed the assessment by testing a rigorous psychometric validation process on thousands of leaders across different industries and business sectors. In the following pages, you will see detailed definitions of the Relational Intelligence skills and where you stand on each of the five dimensions, as well as the potential relational derailers that leaders need to avoid and which of these might be risk factors for you.</p>
