  <h2 class="page_head">How to Use this Report</h2>

  <p>There are some important points to keep in mind as you read this report. First, Relational Intelligence is a skill set that can be learned and developed over time. Just because you score within a specific range does not mean you cannot make improvements in that area. The Bandelli Relational Intelligence Assessment® was designed to raise your self-awareness and give you insights about your relationship-building skills as a leader today. Your results are a data point that can be used in conjunction with other leadership development activities (e.g., development planning, coaching, goal setting, mentoring) to help you grow.</p>

  <p>Second, relationships are reciprocal. This assessment will give you insights into where you can make improvements in how you go about building relationships. However, for a relationship to thrive, there must be a committed and continuous investment made by two people. Practicing these skills will help you to start this process with others.</p>

  <p>Lastly, Relational Intelligence is the quintessential skill set required to effectively lead people, teams, and organizations. When you learn these five skills, put them into practice, and begin modeling them for others, it dramatically improves the quality of your relationships. It takes time, energy, and effort to make relationships work. By developing your Relational Intelligence, you can have a lasting positive impact on others along your leadership journey. </p>
