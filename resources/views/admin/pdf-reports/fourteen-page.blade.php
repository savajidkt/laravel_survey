    Embracing Individual Differences
  </div>
  <ul>
  <li>Model authenticity for your people. This will break down traditional workplace barriers and create a healthier and more empathic company culture.</li>
  <li>Create channels of consistent communication with coworkers — the more you communicate with colleagues, the greater your opportunity to strengthen relationships over time.</li>
  <li>Actively encourage your employees to take the initiative and learn from one another. This will create a learning culture in your organization over time. </li>
  <li>Look for ways to develop a common language around what “inclusivity” means for your organization. This helps create the conditions in which employees can be their true selves at work. </li>
  <li>Pursue diversity of thought with your people and teams. This will help your people develop innovative and creative ideas to grow your business.</li>
  </ul>

  Developing Trust
  </div>
  <ul>
  <li>Take time to learn about yourself. Get clear on your values, the things that you do well, and where you might have blind spots or derailers when you are not at your best.</li>
  <li>As a leader, you must be comfortable being vulnerable with your employees when it is appropriate to do so. This will encourage team members to ask for help when they run into challenges.</li>
  <li>Be committed to your people and consistent in how you show up as a leader. Employees pay more attention to what you do, not what you say.</li>
  <li>Be honest, open, and transparent with your coworkers. A leader with high integrity will always gain a following from the people in their organizations.</li>
  <li>Live with a “deposit mentality.” This means being intentionally generous with your time and making sacrifices for your people to continuously invest in developing your relationships.</li>
  </ul>

  Cultivating Influence
  </div>
  <ul>
  <li>Make sure that you are accessible to all your employees. Do not “play favorites” with your top performers or avoid those who may be struggling at work. Everyone on your team should be able to come to you for guidance and support.  </li>
  <li>Actively look for ways to consistently mentor and coach your people. Make a habit of providing regular developmental feedback so your employees know you are invested in their growth.</li>
  <li>Let your people know you understand that mistakes happen, lessons should be learned along the way, and you will support them through the tough times. </li>
  <li>When providing feedback to your people, make sure to listen to them as well. Often the best developmental conversations happen when your people feel heard and understood.</li>
  <li>Support the careers of your coworkers. Involve others in projects, delegate tasks when possible, and look for opportunities to partner with colleagues on important initiatives.</li>
  </ul>
