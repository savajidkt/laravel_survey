  <h3 class="report_head">Relational implications</h3>
  <p class="report_p">Leaders with similar scores tend to:</p>
  @if($establishing_report_per < 49) 
  <ul>
  <li>Focus on the task at hand rather than the impression they make on coworkers</li>
  <li>Seem direct and usually focus on getting their message across to colleagues</li>
  <li>Be less concerned about finding common ground with others</li>
  <li>Have difficulties noticing social cues and the body language of coworkers</li>
  <li>Prefer to stick to business-related topics rather than discuss personal ones</li>

    <h3 class="report_head">Leadership implications</h3>
    <p class="report_p">Compared to other leaders, your scores suggest that you may seem reserved or socially reticent when meeting people for the first time. Colleagues may view you as quiet and somewhat unenthusiastic about small talk or exchanging pleasantries. New members of your team may see you as hard to get to know and perhaps shy, uninterested, or aloof. Your interactions with new employees tend to focus on work outcomes and holding people accountable for performance. Because you are comfortable working alone, you may miss out on opportunities to connect new employees to other members of your team.</p>

    <p class="report_p">Compared to other leaders, your scores suggest that you understand how to build rapport with both internal and external stakeholders of your organization. The motto “you never get a second chance to make a good first impression,” resonates with you. You have an innate ability to pick the appropriate energy needed for a given audience and tailor your interpersonal style to the people with whom you are interacting. When communicating with new employees, you make them feel valued and appreciated. You ask questions to draw others into a conversation and connect on shared experiences or interests. From the first day someone joins your team, you look to create opportunities for enjoyable interactions and personal connections.</p>
