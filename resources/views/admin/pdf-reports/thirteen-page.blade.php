  Establishing Rapport
  </div>
  <ul>
  <li>Look for ways to make a strong first impression on others. This can include how you dress or your appearance, what you say to others when you first meet them, and how actively you engage in the conversation. </li>
  <li>Maintain good eye contact when speaking and listening to others. Use eye contact to build credibility, convey openness, and share your point of view.</li>
  <li>Focus on demonstrating the right nonverbal communication and body language to show people you are engaged in the conversation.</li>
  <li>Identify areas of common ground with others so they feel heard, valued, and appreciated. Look for ways to connect on shared experiences and interests.</li>
  <li>Give genuine and sincere compliments to build connections with others. Specific compliments can draw people into conversations.</li>
  </ul>

  Understanding Others
  </div>
  <ul>
  <li>Look for opportunities to cultivate and use your emotional intelligence. Develop a better understanding of your emotions, how to read the emotions of others, and how to effectively manage emotions when conflicts arise so you can connect with others on a deeper level.</li>
  <li>Use active listening skills and curiosity. Remember to paraphrase, reflect on what others are saying, and don’t interrupt them.</li>
  <li>Try to display a genuine interest in what your coworkers say. People can sense when you are “going through the motions” rather than actively listening to them.</li>
  <li>Be willing to put yourself in other peoples’ shoes as they share more about themselves. This will enable you to develop a deeper connection with them.</li>
  <li>Share information about your leadership journey and the lessons you have learned along the way. Understanding others isn’t just learning about people, it’s about sharing your experiences as well.</li>
  </ul>
